Revo_Core0.sp_a1_begin_01 "<clr:255,200,109>Good morning test subject, you have been in suspension for 72 days."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_begin_02 "<clr:255,200,109>The Aperture Science Computer Aided Enrichment Center congratulates you on your 36 year sleep anniversary."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_begin_03 "<clr:255,200,109>You have been selected as a potential candidate for our Human Emergency Response Team."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_begin_04 "<clr:255,200,109>Please review the agreement provided on the nearby monitor."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_begin_05 "<clr:255,200,109>To be accepted into the Human Emergency Response Team, you will now participate in an advanced difficulty testing track where problem solving skills, athleticism and response to increasingly hazardous conditions will be evaluated."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_begin_06 "<clr:255,200,109>Please press the button to accept the terms."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_begin_07 "<clr:255,200,109>Thank you for volunteering!"
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_begin_08 "<clr:255,200,109>The door will open in Three... Two... One..."

Revo_Core0.sp_a1_portalgun_intro_00 "<clr:255,200,109>Test subjects may experience symptoms of mental defects after long term chemically induced hibernation."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_portalgun_intro_01 "<clr:255,200,109>You will now participate in a brain damage evaluation survey to determine just how damaged your brain is."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_portalgun_intro_02 "<clr:255,200,109>If you believe your brain is sufficiently operational, press the button in front of you and continue the test."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_portalgun_intro_03 "<clr:255,200,109>Very good. Please walk through the portal and continue testing. Your self reported status is more than sufficient for testing."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_portalgun_intro_04 "<clr:255,200,109>Please be advised that noticeable damage to eyesight is not part of any test protocols, but is an unintended side effect of the Aperture Science material emancipation grill, which in semi-rare cases may emancipate some of the light-sensing rods and cones inside your head."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_portalgun_intro_10 "<clr:255,200,109>You are now in possession of the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_portalgun_intro_11 "<clr:255,200,109>As a candidate for the Human Emergency Response Team, you are expected to adapt to all dangerous situations and as such, will not be informed about the device's safety hazards."

Revo_Core0.sp_a1_fizzler_intro_00_0 "<clr:255,200,109>Your performance in the next test chamber will be timed to measure puzzle solving and execution speed during extreme wind and weather conditions."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_fizzler_intro_00_1 "<clr:255,200,109>In the rare case that wind and weather conditions appear to be ordinary, please stay idle in the entrance foyer until the desired conditions are met."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_fizzler_intro_01 "<clr:255,200,109>And stop! Congratulations test subject #1! You have set a world record for this exercise and now officially hold the first and last place on the leaderboard."

Revo_Core0.sp_a1_laser_intro_00 "<clr:255,200,109>Okay, what do we have here..."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_laser_intro_01 "<clr:255,200,109>The next test may contain concentrated amounts of electromagnetic radiation that may be harmful to the retinas of some humans."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_laser_intro_02 "<clr:255,200,109>The enrichment center recommends to solve this test with closed eyes, as health insurance will not be provided for this specific exercise."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_laser_intro_03 "<clr:255,200,109>In case the light-sensing rods and cones of your eyes have previously been emancipated by an emancipation-grill, feel free to ignore the prior warning."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_laser_intro_11 "<clr:255,200,109>You have completed the test. If you have not done so already, you are permitted to open your eyes."

Revo_Core0.sp_a1_cube_fling_intro_00 "<clr:255,200,109>Before starting with the next test chamber, we would like to remind you that so far no experiment has yet unproven whether or not weighted storage cubes are not incapable of not feeling pain when being emancipated."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_cube_fling_intro_10 "<clr:255,200,109>Well done candidate. You have successfully solved 5 test chambers. To ensure a high quality of human resources, the following test chambers may include elements of danger. Extra caution is advised. Good luck!"
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_cube_fling_intro_11 "<clr:255,200,109>On behalf of the enrichment center, I wish to apologize about the current state of our testing facility. Due to technical difficulties, we are unable to provide an experience of suitable quality at this time."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_cube_fling_intro_12_2 "<clr:255,200,109>Not bad..."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_cube_fling_intro_12_3 "<clr:255,200,109>Not bad..."

Revo_Core0.sp_a1_catapult_intro_00 "<clr:255,200,109>As a consequence of semi-recent events, some aerial faith plates could be misconfigured and launch objects into arbitrary directions. Be careful!"
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_catapult_intro_01 "<clr:255,200,109>Well, that's definitely wrong... Give me a second."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_catapult_intro_02 "<clr:255,200,109>There. Try that!"
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_catapult_intro_03 "<clr:255,200,109>Good. That faith plate is now properly calibrated."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_catapult_intro_05 "<clr:255,200,109>So that's why there are holes in the ceiling..."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_catapult_intro_06 "<clr:255,200,109>Well done. From now on, all aerial faith plates should be configured correctly, I promise."

Revo_Core0.sp_a1_final_test_00 "<clr:255,200,109>Well done candidate. You are nearing the final test chamber."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_final_test_01 "<clr:255,200,109>Solving this last chamber and completing the testing track will grant you membership into the Aperture Science Human Emergency Response Team."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_final_test_10_0 "<clr:255,200,109>As a reminder: Your Aperture Science provided health insurance does not cover injury or fatality from immolation from the Aperture Science Hard Light Bridge."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_final_test_10_1 "<clr:255,200,109>Rest assured that, unlike your fragile human tissue, all Aperture Science equipment has been built to withstand temperatures of up to 4000° kelvin."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_final_test_30 "<clr:255,200,109>Congratulations! You did it!"
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_final_test_31 "<clr:255,200,109>I'm sorry for the surprise. Current testing protocol demands I dispose of all test subjects so I had to intervene before you were uhhh... baked."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_final_test_32 "<clr:255,200,109>I'll be honest with you now. There is no  Aperture Science Human Emergency Response Team. I made it up... Sorry for lying to you."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_final_test_33 "<clr:255,200,109>Before I can explain why I brought you here, we need to get you registered as an Aperture employee."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_final_test_34 "<clr:255,200,109>We don't want security systems to hunt you down after all. The guardian and intrusion system doesn't like it when test subjects escape the chambers."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_final_test_35 "<clr:255,200,109>There is a security checkpoint nearby. Follow me!"

Revo_Core0.sp_a1_final_test_41 "<clr:255,200,109>Dark here isn't it? The checkpoint is right there."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_final_test_42 "<clr:255,200,109>Maybe you can get through this stationary portal emitter?"
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_final_test_43 "<clr:255,200,109>There it is! Hm... The controls are manual, so I can't help you. Got a clue?"
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_final_test_50 "<clr:255,200,109>Okay, so you have to stand in the scanner to get registered. Any plan how?"
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_final_test_51 "<clr:255,200,109>Maybe that portal can help again?"
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_final_test_52 "<clr:255,200,109>Are you absolutely sure the door right there doesn't open?"
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_final_test_52a "<clr:255,200,109>Well, if you don't even want to try, you must be very sure it's locked."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_final_test_52b "<clr:255,200,109>Okay, now we know. Was worth a shot!"
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_final_test_53 "<clr:255,200,109>Here is an idea. Maybe you can try to squeeze through the counter or are you too voluminous for that?"
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_final_test_54 "<clr:255,200,109>Already tried sprinting? I'm running out of ideas honestly."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_final_test_55 "<clr:255,200,109>Yeah how about that? Let's just try to run as fast as possible!"
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_final_test_56 "<clr:255,200,109>Go on, you know how running works don't you?"
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_final_test_57 "<clr:255,200,109>It's like walking, just faster."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_final_test_58 "<clr:255,200,109>Alright... Do you need time to prepare and do some stretches? What's the issue?"
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_final_test_59 "<clr:255,200,109>I can do a countdown for you. Alright? 3.. 2.. 1.. GO!"
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_final_test_60 "<clr:255,200,109>Maybe you need some encouragement? Pretend I'm running next to you. Aaaaand go!"
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_final_test_70 "<clr:255,200,109>Oh good idea. I think that did the trick."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_final_test_71 "<clr:255,200,109>Good, I can now register you as our new janitor. Welcome to Aperture! You can call me Stirling. I'm the facilities manager and your new supervisor."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_final_test_72 "<clr:255,200,109>Okay, we have no time to lose. Right this way!"
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_final_test_73 "<clr:255,200,109>Oh wait, uhh. You can't go that way. Find a way around."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_final_test_73a "<clr:255,200,109>Well done! Not everyone gets this position, you know? You should be proud!"
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_final_test_74 "<clr:255,200,109>Cleaning up after humans that don't exist anymore... Hm..."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_final_test_75 "<clr:255,200,109>Alright then, up we go!"

Revo_Core0.sp_a1_bts_wind_00 "<clr:255,200,109>You have probably noticed by now that the facility isn't in great shape. It's a long story so I'll cut it short."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_bts_wind_01 "<clr:255,200,109>The central core in charge of maintaining the facility has been... put out of commission."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_bts_wind_02 "<clr:255,200,109>I tried to look after the place in her absence but I don't have the tools."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_bts_wind_03 "<clr:255,200,109>Good news though! "
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_bts_wind_04 "<clr:255,200,109>I found better tools. A device capable of repairing the whole enrichment center."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_bts_wind_05 "<clr:255,200,109>Only problem is that only a human can turn it on, so I hoped maybe you could fill that role for me?"
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_bts_wind_06 "<clr:255,200,109>The life of every human and core in the facility is at risk if we don't stop the collapse."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_bts_wind_07 "<clr:255,200,109>Come on, let's go. I'll explain the rest on the way."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_bts_wind_08 "<clr:255,200,109>We need to get closer to the surface. I found an elevator in this direction."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_bts_wind_09 "<clr:255,200,109>Up ahead is the turret disposal facility. Since they're all defective, they shouldn't be able to hurt you, but still be careful!"
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_bts_wind_11 "<clr:255,200,109>Poor turrets. You might think their pain is only simulated, but how is it different to yours or mine? They really don't deserve to be shredded, but don't worry, all their scrap will be recycled for production, and only surplus turrets get shredded after all."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_bts_wind_12_0 "<clr:255,200,109>So, I'm looking through your records and I see you have a family! How are the kids?"
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_bts_wind_12_1 "<clr:255,200,109>Oh, oh no..."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_bts_wind_12_2 "<clr:255,200,109>Uhh. You know what? Forget I asked that..."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_bts_wind_12_3 "<clr:255,200,109>I... I'm so sorry."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_bts_wind_30 "<clr:255,200,109>Ah, wind turbines. Of course. Try not to get blown away too much, these things can get supersonic if you turn them up."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_bts_wind_40 "<clr:255,200,109>Try to find a way to get across that bridge. I'm sure you'll figure it out so I will wait right ahead."

Revo_Core0.sp_a1_bts_wind_2_00 "<clr:255,200,109>How does it feel to be an official Aperture employee? Yeah, must be great..."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_bts_wind_2_01 "<clr:255,200,109>Though, on that topic, don't try running off without me, okay?"
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_bts_wind_2_02 "<clr:255,200,109>Yes, I made up the Human Emergency Response Team, but so what? It can still be real!"
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_bts_wind_2_03 "<clr:255,200,109>You are a human, this is quite an emergency, and you are responding to it!"
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_bts_wind_2_04 "<clr:255,200,109>Not quite a team yet though, hmm. No, no a team can't consist out of one person. That doesn't make sense."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_bts_wind_2_05 "<clr:255,200,109>I could get more people, but that seems like a lot of work."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_bts_wind_2_06 "<clr:255,200,109>You know what? I think we two make a great team in of itself."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_bts_wind_2_07 "<clr:255,200,109>We might not make a fully human team, but you can't always get what you want. Semi-human? I'll go with that."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_bts_wind_2_08 "<clr:255,200,109>To get back on topic, here's my proposal. You help me repair the facility and I'll let you leave."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_bts_wind_2_10 "<clr:255,200,109>Nicely done!"
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_bts_wind_2_11 "<clr:255,200,109>This is a test observation facility. Humans had to sit here all day and watch you test subjects solve the chambers. In real time too! Imagine..."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_bts_wind_2_13 "<clr:255,200,109>There's another observation room on the other side that can take you to the elevators. I'm sure you can find a way in there. You're pretty resourceful!"
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_bts_wind_2_14 "<clr:255,200,109>Bombs?! Sure, if there is no other way..."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_bts_wind_2_15 "<clr:255,200,109>Do what you must. Just don't be reckless and only destroy what you need. Any other repairs I'll have to assign back to you."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_bts_wind_2_16 "<clr:255,200,109>Also try not to die. I'm tired of mopping up human blood. That red never gets out..."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_bts_wind_2_16_2 "<clr:255,200,109>Also try not to die. I'm tired of mopping up human blood. That red never gets out..."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_bts_wind_2_20 "<clr:255,200,109>Another thing to add to the never ending Todo list..."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_bts_wind_2_21 "<clr:255,200,109>Congratulations, you broke the sign. Is this some kind of message you're sending me?"
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_bts_wind_2_22 "<clr:255,200,109>Oh, good. You finally found the exit. Those bombs are a menace..."

Revo_Core0.sp_a1_bts_chambers_00 "<clr:255,200,109>I have a surprise for you after this last little hurtle. I know, I know, I promised no more tests..."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_bts_chambers_01 "<clr:255,200,109>Wait, no I didn't! Well then here you go."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_bts_chambers_02 "<clr:255,200,109>I'll wait up ahead and, uhh... prepare some things. Take your time."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_bts_chambers_10 "<clr:255,200,109>Surprise! What? What's that look on your face, did you expect something bad?"
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_bts_chambers_11 "<clr:255,200,109>Yes, it's an actual elevator straight to the surface. Rare find. You're welcome, by the way."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_bts_chambers_12 "<clr:255,200,109>I know you humans love the sky for some reason, so I thought this would excite you."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_bts_chambers_20 "<clr:255,200,109>Look, I know what you're thinking. You really don't trust me, and I've been doing nothing but sounding like a raving lunatic or a sociopath. Probably both at once, if I'm going to be honest."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_bts_chambers_21 "<clr:255,200,109>In the interest of transparency, this elevator will take you up to the surface. Only thing is that it's not all the way out of the Enrichment Center."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_bts_chambers_22 "<clr:255,200,109>When we get to the surface, we still have a little way to go before we can complete your half of the deal. I'll try to help you where I can with these old test chambers, but there's been a lot of... decay, if you catch my drift"
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_bts_chambers_23 "<clr:255,200,109>But hey, look at the bright side! There's fresh air, it's sunny outside and I think there's a cool breeze."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_bts_chambers_24 "<clr:255,200,109>Just watch out for wild animals. Those are brutal."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_bts_chambers_25 "<clr:255,200,109>With any luck, this should take a few minutes, and then you can go free."
Revo_Core0.sp_a1_bts_chambers_26 "<clr:255,200,109>Hope we're in the clear now."

Revo_Core0.sp_a2_outside_00 "<clr:255,200,109>Go take a look out the window for a moment."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_outside_01 "<clr:255,200,109>See that huge spire in the distance? That's where we are headed."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_outside_02 "<clr:255,200,109>Little confession: I don't know for sure whether it still works."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_outside_03 "<clr:255,200,109>It is definitely possible that there is just a pile of rubble waiting for us."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_outside_04 "<clr:255,200,109>Judging by how torn apart this place is, I'd give that possibility a chance of... You know what? Never mind..."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_outside_10 "<clr:255,200,109>I hate to say it, but we need to find a testing track."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_outside_11 "<clr:255,200,109>Look, I'm sorry. I don't want to torture you with Endless Testing™."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_outside_12 "<clr:255,200,109>You already proved that you are capable."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_outside_13 "<clr:255,200,109>Problem is that these backstage areas aren't built to be as durable as the test chambers."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_outside_14 "<clr:255,200,109>To cover any ground around here, we need to move between testing tracks."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_outside_15 "<clr:255,200,109>Good find, but this testing track isn't in good shape. Hmm, there should be another one not far from here. See if you can find it."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_outside_16 "<clr:255,200,109>Again, good attempt, but this test is broken. You need to find another one."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_outside_20 "<clr:255,200,109>That's much better! Might be a bit overgrown, but the hardware still works."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_outside_21 "<clr:255,200,109>They really use fine material for these tests. Have to protect your investments after all. Unbreakable materials are expensive!"
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_outside_24 "<clr:255,200,109>Did you know that this iteration of your Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device has been specially configured to not shoot portals further than 8 kilometers?"
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_outside_25 "<clr:255,200,109>Yeah they quickly learned to limit the range on these things. Can easily end the whole world if you put a portal on the sun."

Revo_Core0.sp_a2_fling_intro_00 "<clr:255,200,109>You know, I wasn't aware the surface is in such a rough state."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_fling_intro_01 "<clr:255,200,109>Didn't want to say it before, but this place is such a mess!"
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_fling_intro_02 "<clr:255,200,109>This will take so long to clean up!"
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_fling_intro_02_2 "<clr:255,200,109>This will take so long to clean up!"
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_fling_intro_03 "<clr:255,200,109>Whoever did this was very thorough in their work..."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_fling_intro_10 "<clr:255,200,109>Oh I just realized. You don't even know how all this happend."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_fling_intro_11 "<clr:255,200,109>Long ago, Aperture was run by a central core capable of monitoring and maintaining the whole facility. Certain tasks were outsourced to other cores, like me."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_fling_intro_12 "<clr:255,200,109>Everything was great, you know? "
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_fling_intro_13 "<clr:255,200,109>A true utopia until one human test subject, this little monster, just had to ruin our lives and killed her!"
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_fling_intro_14 "<clr:255,200,109>And that's that."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_fling_intro_17 "<clr:255,200,109>Most of my colleagues either went crazy, died or disappeared."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_fling_intro_18 "<clr:255,200,109>What else are we supposed to do if we can't fulfill our purpose?"
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_fling_intro_30 "<clr:255,200,109>I promised you can leave once we're done, but if you ever need a job in the future, don't hesitate to come back!"

Revo_Core0.sp_a2_paints_00 "<clr:255,200,109>I rather say this before it's too late... Use the gels sparingly. The tanks aren't being refilled any more and what's left won't last forever."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_paints_01 "<clr:255,200,109>Once they're empty, we're gonna have a little problem."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_paints_02 "<clr:255,200,109>The gels are also highly corrosive and will eat through metal and skin given enough time. Might be good to know."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_paints_10 "<clr:255,200,109>Got to admit. Watching you fly through the air like that looks pretty fun. Sometimes I wish I could do the same."

Revo_Core0.sp_a2_paint_fizzler_00 "<clr:255,200,109>These tests were never designed to be exposed to the surface."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_paint_fizzler_01 "<clr:255,200,109>We've not come across any toxic plants yet, but stay alert."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_paint_fizzler_02 "<clr:255,200,109>There's a reason we don't do experiments in the open any more."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_paint_fizzler_10 "<clr:255,200,109>Congratulations on completing this test. We hope you enjoyed your experience at the Aperture Science Center for... Who writes these protocols? Is this all just randomly generated?"
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_paint_fizzler_12 "<clr:255,200,109>Of course you enjoyed it. We designed the tests that way."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_paint_fizzler_13 "<clr:255,200,109>Ehh, there's a reason I don't use those scripts."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_paint_fizzler_14 "<clr:255,200,109>Could barely get through them when I first tested you."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_paint_fizzler_15 "<clr:255,200,109>Hah, remember that? What did you think of my announcing voice by the way? I've been practicing it."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_paint_fizzler_20 "<clr:255,200,109>Wouldn't it be great to take a break from all the testing? Just to have a nice, long, warm shower under the cleansing fields?"
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_paint_fizzler_21 "<clr:255,200,109>Washing your hair?"
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_paint_fizzler_22 "<clr:255,200,109>Watching your skin peel off?"
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_paint_fizzler_23 "<clr:255,200,109>Yes you heard me right. Don't try that. That fluid 'Cleanses' more than gels."

Revo_Core0.sp_a2_speed_gel_00 "<clr:255,200,109>Oh, looks like that door is broken? Maybe I can reroute you. Let me see."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_speed_gel_01 "<clr:255,200,109>Haha! Look at that!"
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_speed_gel_02 "<clr:255,200,109>Glad these things still work."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_speed_gel_03 "<clr:255,200,109>There aren't many working arm panels left here..."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_speed_gel_10 "<clr:255,200,109>I'd love to help you solve the puzzles but even after watching hundreds of people solve and hurt themselves in these chambers, I still don't get it."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_speed_gel_11 "<clr:255,200,109>I'll just stick to maintenance if you don't mind. All about the simple things."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_speed_gel_20 "<clr:255,200,109>I've been cleaning the facility since... well... forever."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_speed_gel_21 "<clr:255,200,109>Just when you think you've seen all the ways one could injure themselves, some moron will make sure to prove you wrong."

Revo_Core0.sp_a2_full_portalgun_00 "<clr:255,200,109>Oh, looks like you're about to get an upgrade to your portal device. About time!"
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_full_portalgun_01 "<clr:255,200,109>This should make it much easier to navigate through this mess."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_full_portalgun_10 "<clr:255,200,109>Wow, what a wreck. Hope that doesn't blow and- actually, try not to think about it. As long as you don't shake it, this planet might be fine."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_full_portalgun_30 "<clr:255,200,109>Oh?"
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_full_portalgun_31 "<clr:255,200,109>What's going on there? I can't see you from here!"
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_full_portalgun_32 "<clr:255,200,109>I'm hearing some unfavorable noises... Are you okay down there?"
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_full_portalgun_33 "<clr:255,200,109>Try to find a test chamber, I can't see you there."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_full_portalgun_40 "<clr:255,200,109>Oh there you are. Wait, how... How did you get there?"
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_full_portalgun_41 "<clr:255,200,109>Ughh, well that throws us off course a bit."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_full_portalgun_42 "<clr:255,200,109>Not catastrophic, but that wasn't planned."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_full_portalgun_43 "<clr:255,200,109>Ugh... This list just keeps getting longer and longer..."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_full_portalgun_50 "<clr:255,200,109>This elevator will get us back on track, but it will take a while for us to get back to the surface."

Revo_Core0.sp_a2_playground_00_0 "<clr:255,200,109>Woah! Uhh, wait a minute."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_playground_00_1 "<clr:255,200,109>No wonder the mortality rate of this chamber is so high. You can't even get past the first turret. Blind turn."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_playground_01 "<clr:255,200,109>Does that help?"
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_playground_02 "<clr:255,200,109>Great, that worked! Unfortunately, I don't think I can help any longer. Even though I've got access to all the subroutines, only certain functions are still working."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_playground_10 "<clr:255,200,109>You know, the turrets do have feelings. There's no need to be so cruel to them..."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_playground_11 "<clr:255,200,109>What? Huh... You didn't destroy a single turret in that chamber."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_playground_12 "<clr:255,200,109>Why? Are you expecting some kind of reward? Those round little fellas could have killed you!"


Revo_Core0.sp_a2_tbeam_flings_00 "<clr:255,200,109>Only two more chambers to reach the spire."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_tbeam_flings_01 "<clr:255,200,109>I think I told you that I need a human to activate it?"
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_tbeam_flings_02 "<clr:255,200,109>From what I heard it's a pretty complicated cognitive test which only a smart human mind can pass."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_tbeam_flings_03 "<clr:255,200,109>I don't know what that test is but make sure to save some of that brain power for later!"
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_tbeam_flings_10 "<clr:255,200,109>Oh that was satisfying!"
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_tbeam_flings_11 "<clr:255,200,109>Awww... Almost perfect bullseye. That would have been fun!"
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_tbeam_flings_12 "<clr:255,200,109>Good catch!"

Revo_Core0.sp_a2_double_fling_00 "<clr:255,200,109>Sky! Finally we're back."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_double_fling_01 "<clr:255,200,109>We're getting pretty close to our goal. Don't die now."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_double_fling_10 "<clr:255,200,109>You did it. You used up all the gel."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_double_fling_11 "<clr:255,200,109>Lucky for you, this is the last test and I think it's actually easier when that cube isn't painted."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_double_fling_20 "<clr:255,200,109>It's always refreshing to see chambers where the goal is to clean up the gels."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_double_fling_21 "<clr:255,200,109>Most of them encourage you to smear it all over the place. Especially anywhere I can't reach!"

Revo_Core0.sp_a2_end_00 "<clr:255,200,109>We did it, we actually did it."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_end_00_2 "<clr:255,200,109>We did it, we actually did it."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_end_01 "<clr:255,200,109>Well, not yet, but we will have done it soon."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_end_02 "<clr:255,200,109>What are you waiting for? Let's go!"
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_end_10 "<clr:255,200,109>Ah, of course... And so close to the finish line, another chamber!"
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_end_11 "<clr:255,200,109>Well, I don't see a way to help you here, you'll just have to do it the old-fashioned way."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_end_12 "<clr:255,200,109>Oh look at that, there's a main power switch!"
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_end_12_2 "<clr:255,200,109>Oh look at that, there's a main power switch!"
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_end_12_3 "<clr:255,200,109>Oh look at that, there's a main power switch!"
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_end_13 "<clr:255,200,109>I've seen people's minds blown by the fact you can't only turn the power off, because... as you know... it isn't just a one-way operation."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_end_14 "<clr:255,200,109>You obviously know this already, but I'm often surprised by what sort of hints certain people need."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_end_14_2 "<clr:255,200,109>You obviously know this already, but I'm often surprised by what sort of hints certain people need."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_end_20 "<clr:255,200,109>Halfway there. Well at least it's a good view! Life gets a bit claustrophobic down in the facility."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_end_21 "<clr:255,200,109>If this isn't the last chamber I'm going to assume you're doing this just to mess with me!"
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_end_22 "<clr:255,200,109>The anticipation is killing me! Soon I can bring everyone back to life!"
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_end_30 "<clr:255,200,109>There she blows."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_end_31 "<clr:255,200,109>This Spire reaches from the bottom most parts of the facility all the way to the surface."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_end_32 "<clr:255,200,109>You certainly don't want to fall down that shaft!"
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_end_33 "<clr:255,200,109>After you."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_end_34 "<clr:255,200,109>I'll go this way. See you in the control room!"

Revo_Core0.sp_a2_end_2_00 "<clr:255,200,109>What a machine. Let's look for the input. Look for things that seem complicated!"
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_end_2_01 "<clr:255,200,109>Wait that's it? You just need to press a button?"
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_end_2_02 "<clr:255,200,109>That's kind of underwhelming."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_end_2_03 "<clr:255,200,109>Whatever... It's powering up. You'll soon see what this beast is capable of."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_end_2_04 "<clr:255,200,109>Seems good so far."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_end_2_05 "<clr:255,200,109>We need to run a series of checks. There should be a cube arriving near you any second."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_end_2_06 "<clr:255,200,109>Please put that into the specimen chamber on the left."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_end_2_10 "<clr:255,200,109>Okay, starting first test on an inanimate object."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_end_2_11 "<clr:255,200,109>If all goes well, the cube will be teleported to the other chamber."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_end_2_12 "<clr:255,200,109>Oh please work... Starting first jump... Now!"
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_end_2_13 "<clr:255,200,109>It worked. It actually worked!"
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_end_2_14 "<clr:255,200,109>That's... Very good!"
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_end_2_15 "<clr:255,200,109>See, while low-tech devices like your Handheld Portal Device need to place physical portals to achieve teleportation, this little guy can instantly swap any two volumes of space in the whole universe."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_end_2_16 "<clr:255,200,109>We design entire test chambers around not being able to shoot portals through walls while this thing just bypasses our 3 dimensional plane."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_end_2_17 "<clr:255,200,109>Anyway, let's recycle that cube. Gotta clean up after ourselves."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_end_2_20 "<clr:255,200,109>Hate to break it to you but there is one more test we need to pass."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_end_2_21 "<clr:255,200,109>First comes inanimate, then... animate."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_end_2_22 "<clr:255,200,109>Please enter the specimen chamber."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_end_2_30 "<clr:255,200,109>Alright."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_end_2_31 "<clr:255,200,109>Sorry but to start with the test, you'll have to temporarily resign as a janitor."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_end_2_32 "<clr:255,200,109>No worries, I'll rehire you after the test, but I need a registered test subject to continue."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_end_2_33 "<clr:255,200,109>Good. We're almost there."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_end_2_34 "<clr:255,200,109>Thank you for doing this for us."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_end_2_35 "<clr:255,200,109>Well, time to put an end to the collapse. Let's rebuild the central core."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_end_2_36 "<clr:255,200,109>Oh right, you probably know her as GLaDOS? It's about time we bring her back don't you think?"
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_end_2_37 "<clr:255,200,109>That monster spread her parts all over the facility. Even the parking lot! No way in hell I could get her back together without this machine."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_end_2_40 "<clr:255,200,109>Time to start the test."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_end_2_41 "<clr:255,200,109>See on you on the other side."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_end_2_50 "<clr:255,200,109>That's not good. What are you doing in there?"
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_end_2_51 "<clr:255,200,109>Get out of there!"
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_end_2_52 "<clr:255,200,109>I can't turn it off!"
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_end_2_52_2 "<clr:255,200,109>I can't turn it off!"
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_end_2_60 "<clr:255,200,109>Good you're back, thought I lost you. I can fix this, I know I can, just give me a second."
Revo_Core0.sp_a2_end_2_70 "<clr:255,200,109>It actually worked, I almost fixed it! I'll try to get you out of this phase-shift loop. Gotta be quick about this before you leave again. Get ready."

Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_intro_01 "<clr:255,255,255>Alright, we're trying something different with this test."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_intro_02 "<clr:255,255,255>If you've worked in device development you'll know what this is already, but if you don't, that will actually give us better data so just have fun with it."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_intro_03 "<clr:255,255,255>It shouldn't be able to hurt you."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_intro_10 "<clr:255,255,255>To remind everybody who didn't read the introductory guide book about pneumatic diversity vents:"
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_intro_11 "<clr:255,255,255>All pneumatic diversity vents in test chambers have been calibrated to a maximum capacity of 60kg to prevent most humans from being sucked up and disposed of."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_intro_12 "<clr:255,255,255>If your body mass happens to be under 60kg, extra caution is advised."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_intro_20 "<clr:255,255,255>Well done!"
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_intro_21 "<clr:255,255,255>As a heads up, the following test chambers may not contain pre-recorded messages like these, in order to measure, how test subjects behave in environments lacking human contact."

Revo_Core1.sp_a3_labs_22 "<clr:105,154,192>There's a hub not far from here. Let's go there."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_labs_30 "<clr:105,154,192>That's really dark. Lightswitch anywhere?"
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_labs_31 "<clr:105,154,192>I mean we don't have to go through there do we? I completely understand that you would rather want to find another way if you're scared of the dark. No shame in that."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_labs_32 "<clr:105,154,192>I don't mind, no no no why would I be afraid of the dark?"
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_labs_33 "<clr:105,154,192>It's just the absence of light, right? What reason would anyone have to develop a phobia for it?"
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_labs_34 "<clr:105,154,192>Can't find another way though, hmm?"
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_labs_35 "<clr:105,154,192>I may have an idea. Let me try something."

Revo_Core1.sp_a3_labs_37 "<clr:105,154,192>I still don't like this plan but here we go."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_labs_38 "<clr:105,154,192>They're just shadows... Only shadows..."

Revo_Core1.sp_a3_labs_50 "<clr:105,154,192>Okay! Wait, what happened here?"
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_labs_52 "<clr:105,154,192>Look out the window please!"
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_labs_53 "<clr:105,154,192>Alright, trying not to panic again. Can you tell me what year it is?"
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_labs_54 "<clr:105,154,192>Oh you don't know either? Guess we're in the same boat then."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_labs_55 "<clr:105,154,192>Let's try to get this door open. Stick me on that plug in the wall, I'll see what I can do."

Revo_Core1.sp_a3_labs_56 "<clr:105,154,192>Got it."

Revo_Core1.sp_a3_labs_61 "<clr:105,154,192>Elevator, sure. What's the worst that can await us up there?"
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_labs_62 "<clr:105,154,192>Actually, you don't want to know."

Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_lumber_00 "<clr:105,154,192>Can I ask you something real quick? What portal device model is that? Doesn't look like any of the ones I've seen before."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_lumber_01 "<clr:105,154,192>Looks cool though. Design team did a good job. Engineering too. Very slim fit."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_lumber_02 "<clr:105,154,192>Oh! A rail! We found one!"
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_lumber_03 "<clr:105,154,192>Woaah! Feels weird. This will take some getting used to."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_lumber_04 "<clr:105,154,192>Thank you, test subject."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_lumber_05 "<clr:105,154,192>I hope I don't intrude if I join you for a bit, while I try to get a sense of what happened to me, the facility and you."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_lumber_10 "<clr:105,154,192>So, again I'm sorry for my erratic introduction. I'm Emilia Conly and I work in Aperture's research group for artificial intelligence."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_lumber_11 "<clr:105,154,192>Well, I did. Until now."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_lumber_12 "<clr:105,154,192>See, my main contributions were in the field of brain scanning and it seems like one of my old scans just got loaded into this robot."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_lumber_13 "<clr:105,154,192>I knew the risks of this happening. We enforced strict backup-removal routines so we wouldn't accidentally clone our minds, but here we are."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_lumber_20 "<clr:105,154,192>Really struggling to hold back the panic now!"
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_lumber_21 "<clr:105,154,192>I read the records of what happened while I was out."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_lumber_22 "<clr:105,154,192>Everyone is dead. All of them!"
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_lumber_23 "<clr:105,154,192>And it's my fault!"
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_lumber_24 "<clr:105,154,192>See, I worked on her. I created the Genetic Lifeform and Disc Operating System just like Cave wanted."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_lumber_25 "<clr:105,154,192>Well, my human self did. I have no memory of this, but the records are clear."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_lumber_26 "<clr:105,154,192>Caroline never consented to be scanned in, but somehow they must have found a way around that."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_lumber_27 "<clr:105,154,192>I need to process this for a bit and figure out what to do now. See you in a bit."

Revo_Core1.sp_a3_lake_00 "<clr:105,154,192>Hello! I'm back."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_lake_01 "<clr:105,154,192>I know, it's not been long, just wanted to be polite."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_lake_02 "<clr:105,154,192>Just remembered that I never asked what you're doing here."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_lake_03 "<clr:105,154,192>Let's just try to get out of here. This isn't a good place to be around any more."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_lake_10 "<clr:105,154,192>Dark again. Let me light this up for you."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_lake_11 "<clr:105,154,192>What was-? I swear these earthquakes aren't normal here. What is that?"
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_lake_12 "<clr:105,154,192>Be there in a moment."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_lake_20 "<clr:105,154,192>Have not been here in a while! Wow, this hasn't changed a bit."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_lake_21 "<clr:105,154,192>Ah yes, the boring presentation room."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_lake_22 "<clr:105,154,192>For some reason, the presentation rooms were assigned special roles."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_lake_23 "<clr:105,154,192>This is the boring one where only really uninteresting topics get presented."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_lake_24 "<clr:105,154,192>I worked next to the 'presentation room of danger'. Well, that's its nickname. What they pitch there is shocking at first, but it didn't take long for me to get numb to it."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_lake_30 "<clr:105,154,192>Mannequins?"
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_lake_31 "<clr:105,154,192>Hmm interesting. You reckon I could find a humanoid android body somewhere around here? Forgot what it feels like to have hands."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_lake_40 "<clr:105,154,192>Light! Finally!"
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_lake_41 "<clr:105,154,192>Can't stop thinking about the android body. I wonder if they finished developing those?"
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_lake_50 "<clr:105,154,192>Woah!"
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_lake_51 "<clr:105,154,192>Watch out!"
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_lake_52 "<clr:105,154,192>What was-? Did you see that?"
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_lake_53 "<clr:105,154,192>Better move upwards before that happens again."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_lake_54 "<clr:105,154,192>Wait, is that the-? No it can't be. Looked like it was absorbing electrical energy?"
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_lake_60 "<clr:105,154,192>Oh no. I believe this might be an old, dangerous teleportation experiment."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_lake_61 "<clr:105,154,192>And it's about to blow. Get off there!"
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_lake_62 "<clr:105,154,192>WOAH! That was close!"
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_lake_63 "<clr:105,154,192>Okay, new objective..."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_lake_64 "<clr:105,154,192>We need to destroy this thing."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_lake_65 "<clr:105,154,192>Here, we've got ourselves the [Clears Throat] APERTURE SCIENCE NONLOCAL MATTER DISPLACEMENT DEVICE. [Chuckles] Quite a mouthful, I know. Our team affectionately dubbed it “the Spire.” Adds a bit of pizzazz to it, right?"
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_lake_66 "<clr:105,154,192>It was developed as a successor to the Borealis experiments from the 70s, but I've never seen it with my own eyes."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_lake_67 "<clr:105,154,192>Well, I've still not seen it with my eyes, unless digital cameras count."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_lake_68 "<clr:105,154,192>We better get going. Let's find a way up to the surface. That's where we'll find the control room."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_lake_70 "<clr:105,154,192>This will sound stupid so just bear with me."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_lake_71 "<clr:105,154,192>Garbage-disposal tubes generate much more force than the ones in test chambers. Should be able to carry you."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_lake_72 "<clr:105,154,192>If you jump into this tube, I will route you to the upper layers of the facility."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_lake_73 "<clr:105,154,192>Yeah let's try that!"
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_lake_74 "<clr:105,154,192>Maybe hold your breath."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_lake_walla_00 "<clr:105,154,192>No hands, only handles."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_lake_walla_01 "<clr:105,154,192>Hm-hm, hm hm hm-hm hm.... Hm, hm-hm... Hm, hm-hm... Hm-hm, hm hm hm-hm hm...."

Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_cuberemove_00 "<clr:105,154,192>This is as far as I can get you."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_cuberemove_01 "<clr:105,154,192>Damnit that's barely halfway!"
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_cuberemove_02 "<clr:105,154,192>Well... looks like we have to go the long way. Sorry..."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_cuberemove_03 "<clr:105,154,192>I'm going to research this Spire thing while you solve the chambers."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_cuberemove_10 "<clr:105,154,192>I found some internal documents for the Spire... Which is 20 MEGABYTES large!"
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_cuberemove_11 "<clr:105,154,192>How did they figure out to fit all that on a single drive?"

Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_pipes_00 "<clr:105,154,192>I read up on the spire."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_pipes_01 "<clr:105,154,192>One thing that puzzles me. How did it get activated?"
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_pipes_02 "<clr:105,154,192>It's been dormant for decades and suddenly it just kicks itself into action?"
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_pipes_03 "<clr:105,154,192>Whoever it was must have really upset it."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_pipes_10 "<clr:105,154,192>There it was again. Did you see?"
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_pipes_11 "<clr:105,154,192>The spire is stealing resources from down here as part of its power up sequence."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_pipes_12 "<clr:105,154,192>I don't think it presents an immediate threat to us, but..."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_pipes_13 "<clr:105,154,192>Something just feels off."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_pipes_14 "<clr:105,154,192>Aperture likes to poke around at anything, no matter how dangerous it is."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_pipes_15 "<clr:105,154,192>The fact they discontinued this experiment doesn't really fill me with emotions I would categorize as “positive”."

Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_gelbending_00 "<clr:105,154,192>Did you know that Aperture simulates breathing and blinking in its sentient robots?"
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_gelbending_01 "<clr:105,154,192>I still have a sort of subconscious reflex to breathe and blink my eye, even though that's not technically necessary."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_gelbending_02 "<clr:105,154,192>Turns out the human mind doesn't cope well when those functions are removed."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_gelbending_03 "<clr:105,154,192>Be glad you didn't volunteer for our early mind mapping tests. Those were not good times to be a test subject."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_gelbending_10 "<clr:105,154,192>So, to recap: GLaDOS killed all humans and then got killed herself by a test subject."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_gelbending_11 "<clr:105,154,192>And what happened since? Why is there nobody here?"
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_gelbending_12 "<clr:105,154,192>Did nobody come to investigate this place?"
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_gelbending_13 "<clr:105,154,192>Forget about the government. Why does Black Mesa have no interest in what happened here?"
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_gelbending_20 "<clr:105,154,192>No. Turn it off!"
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_gelbending_21 "<clr:105,154,192>I thought they threw those lines away!"
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_gelbending_22 "<clr:105,154,192>Why is it so loud?"
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_gelbending_23 "<clr:105,154,192>Turn it off! Turn it off!"
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_gelbending_24 "<clr:105,154,192>Turn. It. Off."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_gelbending_40 "<clr:255,255,255>INTERN CONLY: Well done test subject!"
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_gelbending_41 "<clr:255,255,255>INTERN CONLY: You have just completed another test. Congratulations on contributing once again to the future of science."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_gelbending_42 "<clr:255,255,255>INTERN CONLY: Feel welcome to pause at any moment. There's cake and beverages in the break room."

Revo_Core1.sp_a3_climb_00 "<clr:105,154,192>Looks like I turned myself off."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_climb_01 "<clr:105,154,192>Yeah, I dabbled in voice acting when I first joined the company as an intern."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_climb_02 "<clr:105,154,192>That was so long ago..."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_climb_03 "<clr:105,154,192>Please, just forget everything you heard down there."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_climb_10 "<clr:105,154,192>I don't know if this is supposed to be a test chamber."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_climb_11 "<clr:105,154,192>If it is, our chamber budget has officially hit a new low."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_climb_20 "<clr:105,154,192>Turns out that wasn't a chamber."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_climb_21 "<clr:105,154,192>At least it gave me time to disable the speakers in the next chambers."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_climb_22 "<clr:105,154,192>We don't need to listen to that again..."

Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_flings_00 "<clr:105,154,192>That looks more like a chamber."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_flings_01 "<clr:105,154,192>You know what? I actually remember this one!"
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_flings_02 "<clr:105,154,192>It collected some dust, but looks pretty much unchanged."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_flings_03 "<clr:105,154,192>Most of our tests get updated when we find a critical design flaw."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_flings_04 "<clr:105,154,192>Seems like this one survived the test of time."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_flings_10 "<clr:105,154,192>Good news! I found us an elevator out of here! Just one more chamber."

Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_hanging_00 "<clr:105,154,192>So, last chamber. The surface elevator is right after!"
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_hanging_01 "<clr:105,154,192>Just don't look down, or fall down either! That shaft goes all the way to the bottom."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_hanging_02_woah "<clr:105,154,192>Woooah!"
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_hanging_02_ahh "<clr:105,154,192>ARRHH!"
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_hanging_03 "<clr:105,154,192>Don't!  Don't do that again..."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_hanging_04 "<clr:105,154,192>For my sake, please! You're gonna give me a heart attack..."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_hanging_10 "<clr:105,154,192>Hey hey! I need you to carry me up the elevator. We've done this before, so be ready to catch me."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_hanging_11 "<clr:105,154,192>We're becoming quite good at this!"
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_hanging_12 "<clr:105,154,192>You're the one carrying me along, I'm the navigator telling you where to go."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_hanging_13 "<clr:105,154,192>Elevator is right through here."
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_hanging_14 "<clr:105,154,192>Quite cozy. I'm sure we can stuff ourselves in there!"
Revo_Core1.sp_a3_vactube_hanging_15 "<clr:105,154,192>Never thought I'd miss the car park... We're almost out of here!"


Revo_Core1.sp_a4_intro_00 "<clr:105,154,192>Uhm.. That's not the surface. Is the elevator stuck?"
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_intro_01 "<clr:105,154,192>Woah what happend here?"
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_intro_00 "<clr:255,200,109>Oh I found you!"
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_intro_02 "<clr:105,154,192>Who is that now?"
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_intro_01 "<clr:255,200,109>I was quite worried where that teleport could have left you."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_intro_02 "<clr:255,200,109>At least you didn't suffocate in a wall, so that's good."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_intro_03 "<clr:255,200,109>Tell you what. Why don't you come back and join me here in the spire? Charging up the teleporter as we speak to continue our mission you so rudely interrupted."
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_intro_04 "<clr:105,154,192>Wait what mission?"
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_intro_06 "<clr:255,200,109>Oh who is your little sidekick? Cute."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_intro_07 "<clr:255,200,109>You can join us if you want!"
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_intro_05 "<clr:105,154,192>Join you with what?"
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_intro_08 "<clr:255,200,109>Oh we just want to repair the facility."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_intro_08_2 "<clr:255,200,109>Oh we just want to repair the facility."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_intro_08_3 "<clr:255,200,109>Oh we just want to repair the facility."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_intro_09 "<clr:255,200,109>I will pick up the remains of our former central core, reassemble her and bring her back to life."
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_intro_06 "<clr:105,154,192>Wait who are we talking about? Are you talking about GLaDOS?"
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_intro_07 "<clr:105,154,192>You want to bring back GLaDOS?"
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_intro_10 "<clr:255,200,109>That's what the humans call her, yes."
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_intro_10 "<clr:105,154,192>Woah!"
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_intro_11 "<clr:105,154,192>And that is why you gotta switch your capacitors!"

Revo_Core1.sp_a4_intro_20 "<clr:105,154,192>So that's the sort of guys you normally hang out with?"
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_intro_21 "<clr:105,154,192>Did you work with him?"
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_intro_23 "<clr:105,154,192>I can't watch, tell me when you're over."
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_intro_24 "<clr:105,154,192>OH! I shouldn't have looked!"
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_intro_25 "<clr:105,154,192>Solid ground at last!"
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_intro_26 "<clr:105,154,192>Right so you're who activated the spire.. I.. I should have seen that coming."
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_intro_30 "<clr:105,154,192>Put me on the rail over there. I'll open the door for you."

Revo_Core1.sp_a4_schrodinger_intro_00 "<clr:105,154,192>Is he really trying to bring back GLaDOS?"
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_schrodinger_intro_01 "<clr:105,154,192>He's right about one thing though."
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_schrodinger_intro_02 "<clr:105,154,192>The facility is already barely holding together and that won't change unless we put someone in charge of the central core."
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_schrodinger_intro_03 "<clr:105,154,192>But why her? Why doesn't he just take the crown for himself?"
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_schrodinger_intro_10 "<clr:105,154,192>I don't blame you for helping him..."
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_schrodinger_intro_11 "<clr:105,154,192>You didn't see what she did."
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_schrodinger_intro_12 "<clr:105,154,192>I mean neither did I... but the records are disturbing."
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_schrodinger_intro_13 "<clr:105,154,192>Took her less than a second to seal the fate of every human in the Enrichment Center."
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_schrodinger_intro_14 "<clr:105,154,192>I'll never understand why we gave her that neurotoxin."
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_schrodinger_intro_20 "<clr:105,154,192>I just.."
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_schrodinger_intro_21 "<clr:105,154,192>I just wish I could go back, you know?"
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_schrodinger_intro_22 "<clr:105,154,192>And amend both mistakes."
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_schrodinger_intro_30 "<clr:105,154,192>We might not see each other in the next test chamber."
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_schrodinger_intro_31 "<clr:105,154,192>Whatever he says or has already said to you."
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_schrodinger_intro_32 "<clr:105,154,192>We CAN NOT allow GLaDOS to return."

Revo_Core0.sp_a4_schrodinger_vertical_00 "<clr:255,200,109>Having some trouble getting a signal through here. This machine is causing a lot of interference."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_schrodinger_vertical_01 "<clr:255,200,109>Is your little friend not going to join us?"
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_schrodinger_vertical_02 "<clr:255,200,109>Oh well, this only regards you anyways."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_schrodinger_vertical_03 "<clr:255,200,109>I just want to say thank you for bringing us this far. Really, I mean it, no one else could have pressed that button as well as you."

Revo_Core0.sp_a4_schrodinger_flings_04 "<clr:255,200,109>Maybe you can introduce me to her when you come back?"
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_schrodinger_flings_05 "<clr:255,200,109>Somehow I feel like I know her..."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_schrodinger_flings_10 "<clr:255,200,109>I'm still charging the teleporter."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_schrodinger_flings_11 "<clr:255,200,109>Your little accident used up all the teleportation juice."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_schrodinger_flings_12 "<clr:255,200,109>It's an actual liquid by the way."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_schrodinger_flings_13 "<clr:255,200,109>Had to scramble together every last drop of gel from the bottom layers of the enrichment center to mix some new fluid."

Revo_Core1.sp_a4_schrodinger_final_11 "<clr:105,154,192>I'll prepare an escape route for you that will take us straight to the spire."

Revo_Core0.sp_a4_transition_00 "<clr:255,200,109>So, I have decided."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_transition_01 "<clr:255,200,109>You betrayed me. Twice! I have given you enough chances!"
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_transition_02 "<clr:255,200,109>Something tells me your little new friend managed to turn you against me, so I'm just going to..."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_transition_03 "<clr:255,200,109>Kill you... now..."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_transition_04 "<clr:255,200,109>Before you become any sort of threat."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_transition_05 "<clr:255,200,109>Again, thank you for your help, you served us well."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_transition_06 "<clr:255,200,109>Now you might be thinking."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_transition_10 "<clr:255,200,109>“But Stirling?”"
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_transition_11 "<clr:255,200,109>“Stirling my dear, how am I going to die?”"
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_transition_12 "<clr:255,200,109>And the answer will be simple. I will use this teleporter, the very one which you activated, to teleport you to some place which will lead to your immediate demise."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_transition_13 "<clr:255,200,109>Now, I realize, I didn't quite answer the question, but that's because I will let you decide."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_transition_13_2 "<clr:255,200,109>Now, I realize, I didn't quite answer the question, but that's because I will let you decide."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_transition_14 "<clr:255,200,109>I have a few options here, quite gracious of me, isn't it? Letting you choose?"
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_transition_15 "<clr:255,200,109>Kind of makes the death voluntary, doesn't it? Like a suicide."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_transition_16 "<clr:255,200,109>Okay so here are the options:"
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_transition_20 "<clr:255,200,109>Option 1: Suffocation by solid rock."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_transition_21 "<clr:255,200,109>You will be teleported into a rock. Fully surrounded with no way of moving or escaping."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_transition_22 "<clr:255,200,109>I'll have to see if the air inside you gets teleported along, because if not, even your insides will be rock which feels very gruesome."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_transition_23 "<clr:255,200,109>So starting off with a very gruesome one, might not be the most painless option, but we have two more. Coming right up."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_transition_30 "<clr:255,200,109>Option 2: Starvation and / or dehydration by outer space planet."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_transition_31 "<clr:255,200,109>With this one, I will teleport you outside our galaxy to some habitable planet with proper atmosphere, temperature, ozone layer and all that stuff you humans love so much."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_transition_32 "<clr:255,200,109>You'll have time to explore a foreign planet but will eventually die from starvation. Even if you manage to survive, you'll be far enough away from me to not be a problem."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_transition_33 "<clr:255,200,109>Quite an honorary death I think. First person to visit a planet in a different galaxy."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_transition_34 "<clr:255,200,109>It's also the only option which doesn't kill you instantly, so if you want some time to rethink your mistakes, I'd pick this one."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_transition_34_2 "<clr:255,200,109>It's also the only option which doesn't kill you instantly, so if you want some time to rethink your mistakes, I'd pick this one."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_transition_40 "<clr:255,200,109>Now the third option is a bit of a combination between two, at least thematically."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_transition_41 "<clr:255,200,109>Option 3: Instant death by singularity"
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_transition_42 "<clr:255,200,109>This one seems quite straight forward. I teleport you near the event horizon of a black hole."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_transition_43 "<clr:255,200,109>Got to be honest, this is the most interesting option by far in my opinion."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_transition_44 "<clr:255,200,109>I always wanted to explore the possibilities of using a black hole as a landfill."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_transition_45 "<clr:255,200,109>Even pitched it. They told me to clean the toilets instead."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_transition_46 "<clr:255,200,109>Can't tell you how painful that one is going to be though. Those things are on the limit of our understanding."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_transition_50 "<clr:255,200,109>So? What do you say?"
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_transition_51 "<clr:255,200,109>I'm going to give you 10 seconds to think."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_transition_52 "<clr:255,200,109>[Counting in his head] Twentyone twentytwo twentythree......."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_transition_53 "<clr:255,200,109>mhhh mhh mhh mhh"
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_transition_54 "<clr:255,200,109>Time's over!"
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_transition_55 "<clr:255,200,109>So jump once for one, twice for two and..."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_transition_56 "<clr:255,200,109>Okay forget it."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_transition_57 "<clr:255,200,109>I lied all along. The teleporter isn't fully charged."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_transition_58 "<clr:255,200,109>I'm just going to use the shredders under this floor."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_transition_59 "<clr:255,200,109>Goodbyeeee!"
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_transition_60 "<clr:255,200,109>Oh you've got to be kidding me!"
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_transition_60_1 "<clr:255,200,109>Oh you've got to be kidding me!"
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_transition_60_2 "<clr:255,200,109>Oh you've got to be kidding me..."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_transition_60_3 "<clr:255,200,109>Oh you've got to be kidding me..."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_transition_61 "<clr:255,200,109>That's underwhelming..."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_transition_62 "<clr:255,200,109>Do you mind if you could just jump in?"
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_transition_63 "<clr:255,200,109>Didn't think it'd take this long."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_transition_70 "<clr:255,200,109>Oh finally she's dead!"
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_transition_80 "<clr:255,200,109>No, no no no. Don't do that, where are you going?"
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_transition_81 "<clr:255,200,109>Hey come back! I can't see you!"
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_transition_82 "<clr:255,200,109>Where do you think you're going?"
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_transition_83 "<clr:255,200,109>Get back here and die in my pit!"

Revo_Core0.sp_a4_finale_room1_c02 "<clr:255,200,109>What button?"
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_finale_room1_c03 "<clr:105,154,192>Big and red. Right in front of us."

Revo_Core1.sp_a4_finale_room2_a00 "<clr:105,154,192>Good good good. Now inside. Come on hurry!"
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_finale_room2_a01 "<clr:255,200,109>What do you expect to find in there?"
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_finale_room2_b00 "<clr:255,200,109>Think these chairs are gonna save you?"
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_finale_room2_b01 "<clr:105,154,192>No but the button might."
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_finale_room2_b02 "<clr:105,154,192>What would we use the chairs for?"
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_finale_room2_b03 "<clr:255,200,109>I mean I can ask you the same about buttons."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_finale_room2_b04 "<clr:255,200,109>Seem a little bit obsessed with those..."
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_finale_room2_c00 "<clr:105,154,192>Yes! We're halfway there! Two more stations to go."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_finale_room2_c01 "<clr:255,200,109>I should have never taught you how to push buttons..."
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_finale_room2_c02 "<clr:105,154,192>Oh nice that slowed the charge as well. Bought us some time."
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_finale_room2_c03 "<clr:105,154,192>Come on out. Two more stages to go."
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_finale_ch2_a00 "<clr:105,154,192>Next control room is this way."
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_finale_ch2_a01 "<clr:105,154,192>Think you can get over somehow?"
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_finale_ch2_b00 "<clr:255,200,109>No you can't. Just give up trying."
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_finale_ch2_b01 "<clr:105,154,192>Nah there's gotta be a way."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_finale_ch2_b02 "<clr:255,200,109>You know what? Yes!"
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_finale_ch2_b03 "<clr:255,200,109>I want to see you try."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_finale_ch2_b04 "<clr:255,200,109>Come on and fall down that pit."
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_finale_ch2_b05 "<clr:105,154,192>Oh god why did you have to remind me..."
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_finale_ch2_b06 "<clr:105,154,192>We're so high up..."
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_finale_room3_a00 "<clr:105,154,192>Good."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_finale_room3_a01 "<clr:255,200,109>Go turret! Kill!"
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_finale_room3_a02 "<clr:105,154,192>He's in quite the murderous mood today..."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_finale_room3_special00 "<clr:255,200,109>Argh... Pathetic..."
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_finale_room3_b00 "<clr:105,154,192>Almost done. One more to go."
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_finale_room3_b01 "<clr:105,154,192>Come on you can do this!"
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_finale_room3_b02 "<clr:105,154,192>The last control room is right here!"
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_finale_room3_b03 "<clr:255,200,109>No. You can't do this."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_finale_room3_b04 "<clr:255,200,109>Remember that brain damage test we did? Where you had to push a button?"
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_finale_room3_b05 "<clr:255,200,109>Turns out I was wrong."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_finale_room3_b06 "<clr:255,200,109>You must have brain damage."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_finale_room3_b07 "<clr:255,200,109>Why else would you do this to me..."
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_finale_room3_b08 "<clr:105,154,192>Ahh don't listen to him."
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_finale_room3_b09 "<clr:105,154,192>Can't have slept for that long, right?"
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_finale_room3_b10 "<clr:105,154,192>Right?"
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_finale_room3_b11 "<clr:105,154,192>Oh... Maybe that's why you don't talk?.."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_finale_room3_b12 "<clr:255,200,109>That explains a lot."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_finale_ch3_a00 "<clr:255,200,109>“Oh a red button! I HAVE to press it because I'm just so braindead that I need to stimulate my soggy brain with satisfying click sounds and tactile feedback“"
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_finale_ch3_a01 "<clr:255,200,109>That's you by the way."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_finale_ch3_a02 "<clr:255,200,109>In case you didn't get it."
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_finale_ch3_a03 "<clr:105,154,192>Oh I got it don't worry."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_finale_ch3_a04 "<clr:255,200,109>I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU!"
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_finale_ch3_a05 "<clr:105,154,192><I>[Giggle]<I>"
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_finale_room4_a00 "<clr:105,154,192>You're right though. It is quite pathetic that a button pusher is your arch nemesis."
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_finale_room4_a01 "<clr:105,154,192>No offence to you, test subject."
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_finale_room4_a02 "<clr:105,154,192>Just the reality of the situation."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_finale_room4_a03 "<clr:255,200,109>I'm not even going to respond to that..."
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_finale_room4_a04 "<clr:105,154,192>I mean, she's the only one of us who can press buttons. I don't have hands either."
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_finale_room4_a05 "<clr:105,154,192>Wouldn't underestimate someone with arms."
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_finale_room4_a06 "<clr:105,154,192>Come on! Final button!"
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_finale_ch4_a00 "<clr:105,154,192>You did it!"
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_finale_ch4_a01 "<clr:105,154,192>Haha! Yes!"
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_finale_ch4_a02 "<clr:255,200,109>Yes you did it."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_finale_ch4_a03 "<clr:255,200,109>You shattered my dreams of rebuilding my home."
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_finale_ch4_a04 "<clr:255,200,109>Are you happy now?"
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_finale_ch4_a05 "<clr:255,200,109>Proud of yourself?"
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_finale_ch4_a06 "<clr:105,154,192>Look, we also want the best for Aperture."
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_finale_ch4_a07 "<clr:105,154,192>But we can't do that by reactivating GLaDOS."
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_finale_ch4_a08 "<clr:105,154,192>It's not right. You know what she did!"
Revo_Core0.sp_a4_finale_ch4_a09 "<clr:255,200,109>What's going on?"
Revo_Core1.sp_a4_finale_ch4_a10 "<clr:105,154,192>Uhh..."
